# TP Architecture logicielle (File watcher)

Maxime d'HarboullÃ© - 4AL1 - ESGI - 2021
## Description
* Look at the console output while running*  

1. The producer and workers are initialized and connect to each other  

2. Will watch for files in assets/files_watcher, send them to the workers via a message queue (zeroMQ). Then the fileWatcher will recieve messages of workers when the fake treatments are completed and then remove the files from the watcher.  

3. Copy files in the watched directory ```./assets/test_files``` to ->```./assets/files_watcher```, and they should be processed by the workers (in logs, files are found, file is recieved by the worker and then producer recieves message that the worker finished processing the file and deletes the file)
